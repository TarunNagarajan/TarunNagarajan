# I'm Tarun. 

I'm a Computer Science Sophomore at the National Institute of Technology, Warangal. I want to see myself working in AI Inference and Systems Engineering in the near future. As of now, apart from studying Machine Learning, I'm working on three projects codenamed as follows:
| Project Inference (toolchain that takes ONNX operators (e.g., GEMM, Conv) and emits quantized,
sparse-aware compute kernels (in C++/AVX), optimized for desktop/server inference|

| Project Infinity | 
| Project Plasticity|

| Multi-Armed Bandit |
