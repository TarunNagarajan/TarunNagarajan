# 👋 Hey, I'm Tarun

I'm a Computer Science Sophomore at the **National Institute of Technology, Warangal**. I'm studying the intersection of **AI Inference** and **Systems Engineering**.

Currently, I'm working on the implementation of my flagship project named *Infinity*. It's a Systems Engineering project for AI Inference, based on findings from [Vitvitskyi et al., *What Makes a Good Feedforward Computational Graph*, arXiv:2502.06751 (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06751).

## 🛠️ Projects I'm Building

| Project Name       | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Project Inferon** | A toolchain that takes ONNX operators (e.g., `GEMM`, `Conv`, `Relu`) and emits **quantized, sparse-aware compute kernels** in C++/AVX - optimized for desktop/server inference. |
| 🧵 **Project Infinity** | Systems Engineering with Feedforward Networks - exploring internal structure, static computation graphs, and edge-deployable architectures. |
| 🧬 **Project Memory** | Exploring **pattern-aware neural networks** that avoid redundancy during training inspired by memorization patterns in real-world data. |
